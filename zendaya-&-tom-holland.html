            <p>There are lot of speculation weather this cute couple is engaged or not?</p>
            <p>Well, this lovely couple have a great fun together, and enjoy spending time together, and absolutely willing to say “I do!”, and right now pretty much burning to say so. But the relationship itself has not enough of what is needed to hold a ground for a relationship like marriage.</p>
            <p>There are some interesting transits of planets right now (and one that will stay for a while throughout all next year) hitting their relationship (and personal planets), that make them think more seriously about, but that’s something that’s passing, as opposed to being fixed.</p>
            <p>Their Venus is heavily challenged, which is very hard to deal with in intimate relationships, in the long run. They have lot of good will to deal with it tho.</p>
            <p>Theres not much to keep ground strong enough to sustain relationship like marriage, and considering that the relationship itself has challenging configuration (not just Venus), and need extra support, that there isn’t, not getting married is more likely.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, they click at sweet points and that can bind them as a couple for a time being, and in their case more likely as a couple than married couple.</p>
            <p>Marriage could work, kind of, not conventional one, and I don’t see that fitting their individual settings about marriage, thus not in the line with their relationship that is in itself of unconventional nature, hence works the best way that way, and it’s the only way, as there are not enough support to balance its nature.</p>
            <p>*They seem as a very new couple. There are no direct links indicating much of involvement in a past lives, as if they are just starting out now, learning to know each other as they go. When they met for the first time they definitely had no that feeling like “I know this person”….”Have we met before?”.</p>
