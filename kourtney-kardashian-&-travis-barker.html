            <p>Seeing Kourtney & Travis chart explains why these two love birds cannot get hands of each other. They really do hit each other’s sweet spots. There’s so much passion here, I mean they can get pregnant just looking at each other, lol. If these two don’t get pregnant now or next year then…idk…it’s highly unlikely tho. Chart shows they do have desire to have a baby, and that same aspect (they will have now for few years) could be very helpful for conceiving. Kourtney and Travis will be expecting their baby soon for sho if not already, wouldn’t surprise me. They seem to be meant to have their little one or…..two…</p>
            <p>Chart point out, and at many places for him just as for her, how happy they make each other.</p>
            <p>There’s also a rock solid indication that at one point they will decide to part ways, but on the other hand they have links that support relationship, so maybe they part ways but stay close as if they didn’t.</p>
            <p>Chart shows him as the one that will feel over burdened for whatever reason that might be, and needing to get away. Maybe, as chart shows, coz he feels very light and frisky with her, and prefers all fun, no much heavy responsibilities. Also, chart indicate that their fights can get very heated, and then follow with very cold distant passive aggressive situation that hits him directly, and one day at one point he just won’t be able to take it anymore.</p>
            <p>They will part their ways married or not. Most likely married, there are many links indicating it.</p>
            <p>They both are holding their relationship tight tho, they will do their best to make things work for as long they can.</p>
