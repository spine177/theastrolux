            <p>Venus-Pluto aspects in composite are absolutely the best aspects for love and sex.</p>
            <p>Venus Pluto aspects in composite chart are responsible for deep emotional and physical intimacy, rapturous sex (with Mars in the mix) enduring love, and undying sexual attraction.</p>
            <p>Venus-Pluto aspects in composite chart means that you as a couple have a deep love for one another, great sexual attraction and deeply satisfying love life.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">Composite Venus Conjunct/Trine/Square Composite Pluto</h3>
            <p>If you and your partner have Venus conjunct/trine/square Pluto in composite you are very blessed as you will expirience love in its most transformative form.</p>
            <p>Venus Pluto in the composite chart shows that both of you will be transformed in this relationship with the transformative power of love, as this connection between you has intensity and power to reach the deepest depths of your being at the highest heights of your love. That is where many song lyrics like “you bring me closer to God” comes from.</p>
            <p>You arouse soul deep, passionate such intense feelings within each other, that physical intimacy is charged with such intensity that makes your love life incredibly powerful, and beautiful, steamy, and so sweet that is addictive, and you just can’t be without each other, and don’t want to be without each other. You are deeply and intensely involved with each other.</p>
            <p>This profound connection stimulates intense soul deep feelings and you will want all-or-nothing. Desire to completely “posses” one another, each others’ all, mind and body and soul, comes naturally at this depths of connection this bond binds you.</p>
            <p>Wanting to possess one another (in a good way) as with this bond that these aspects indicates, is not to be confused with possessiveness that is present in some other connections that comes from a different place, One comes from deep loving place and the other is ego driven from the luck of deep enough connection, where just Mars is involved with Pluto but no Venus in the mix. (Venus Pluto Mars is the perfect mix for the love and sex.) For the two of you it feels natural, deeply loving and sweet wanting to possess one another each other’s all, mind body and soul.</p>
